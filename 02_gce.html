<h1>GCE Subnets</h1>
<p>Be default:</p>
<p>Each VPC has a default network, with 37 subnets (one for each region)</p>
<p>Each subnet has a private block, such as 10.128.0.0/20 for us-central1</p>
<p>Each subnet has a routing table, with 37 entries + a default</p>
<p>Each VPC has a firewall to allow ingress icmp/ssh/rdp from anything, and allow all traffic from other internal subnets</p>
<p>There is a default deny-all-ingress, and allow-all-egress rule at the end</p>
